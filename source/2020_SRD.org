  - Sign up using your school email address and a new password
  - You may be asked to verify your account. If so, please use this link [[https://webmail.bourne-grammar.lincs.sch.uk/][BGS Webmail]] to log into your school email account.
  - Spend an hour on the =Make a Website= course by following the instructions.
  - Take a screenshot of your final stage of your progress with the course and upload to bournetolearn.
  - Please note, the instructions and help notes are on the left side of the window. 
- Alternatively, if you do not have access to the link above:
  - Sketch a design of your webpage on paper
  - Write down on each area what you plan to put, for example, paragraph, image, bulletin point, hyper links etc.

- Ever wonder how computers beat us at games? Let’s investigate and find out by looking at the simple game of Naught’s Crosses.
- What is the secret of winning at naught and crosses? Research what are the winning strategies. 
- Using structured English write down the steps you would follow to win at naught and crosses. Try and include the winning strategy you have researched.
 
[[./img/NaughtCross.png]]
- Example (structured English).
#+BEGIN_SRC 
If the middle is empty, then
     choose the middle (space E)
Else if any of the corners are available, then
     Randomly choose a corner
Else if the corners are taken then...
#+END_SRC


- *Extension tasks*
  - Now for a bonus achievement point write down your strategy using Pseudo Code, or python for the real ambitious.

  - Let’s assume we need to have 9 variables, one to represent each of the 9 places (letters A to I, see the image above) that we can write either a “0” or a “X” into. These can store the following values; 0 = naught, 1 = crosses, 2 = blank.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Psuedo Code Example 1
Player = 0   (set 0 for player 1, set 1 for Player 2)
If  E = 2 then E = Player 
Else If A = 2 or C= 2 or G = 2 or I=2               
       Randomly choose A,C G or I
#+END_SRC 


#+BEGIN_SRC 
Python Code Example  2
Player = 0  (set 0 for player 1, set 1 for Player 2)
If  E == 2:
     E = Player
elif (A == 2) or (C== 2) or (G == 2) or (I == 2):
     choice = randint(1,4)

- You’re going to investigate and research SQL. To start find the definition for SQL concerning databases. Open a text editor of your choice and explain what SQL is, including an example.
- To get some hands on experience and see what SQL can do, followy this [[https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_BBC_Tutorial][link]]
- Once on the site, take a look at the table that contains four records.
- Then run the first SQL Command by pressing the Submit SQL button and examine what the results are like. Yous should see something like the following:
[[./img/SQL-1.png]]

- Now write down the name of the *Table* used, the *Fields* you have selected and explain how the SQL Select command works.

- Continue working through questions 2 to 6, remembering the symbols for Greater than > and less than <.

- If you are having difficulty,  then try the [[https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics][SELECT basics]]
- Screen shot or take a photo your progress and upload to *Database* SRD work badge on www.bournetolearn.com

- From Asteroids to Grand Theft Auto, video games have been around for awhile. With massive game worlds and story lines fit for any big budget movie. 
- Video games have come along way since their birth in the late 70's and are one of the most popular forms of entertainment today. 
- So what makes successful games? Asteroids was extremely popular when it was created, but today it probably wouldn't catch someone's attention for more than a few minutes. Let's look at some examples of successful games in the past to identify the key ingredients that, when added together, create a memorable and appealing experience that can hold up to today's market.
*** Task:
- Evaluate two games you have played in the following aspects:
  - Name of the game
  - Genre
  - What is the purpose of the game
  - Rules
  - Mechanics
  - Platform
  - What is the reward system
  - In your opinion, what makes the game addictive/enjoyable to play?

- *Alternatively*, if you do not play video games:
  - Open Scratch by clicking on [[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/79700266/#editor/][this]] link.
  - Once inside the project, click the green flag icon (top-middle of screen) to run the program.
  - Replace the 'Square' command with 'Pentagon', as directed on the page.
  - *TASK:* Make the program draw a pentagon. Upload a screenshot of your code and of the shape.
  - Swap the 'pentagon' command for 'pattern'. Think about how this works.
  - *TASK:* Modify the code to make a program to draw a pattern of your own.
    - You could have something made from 50 triangles
    - Or a square, then a pentagon one after the other before rotating a bit and repeating
    - Or you could change the pen colour a bit after each shape is drawn.
  - Remember - you can't break anything, so don't be afraid to experiment.
  - Upload a screenshot of your best pattern AND a shot of your code to BourneToLearn.
