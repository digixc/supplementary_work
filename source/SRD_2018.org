- From Asteroids to Grand Theft Auto, video games have been around for awhile. With massive game worlds and story lines fit for any big budget movie. 
- Video games have come along way since their birth in the late 70's and are one of the most popular forms of entertainment today. 
- So what makes successful games? Asteroids was extremely popular when it was created, but today it probably wouldn't catch someone's attention for more than a few minutes. Let's look at some examples of successful games in the past to identify the key ingredients that, when added together, create a memorable and appealing experience that can hold up to today's market.
*** Task:
- Evaluate two games you have played in the following aspects:
  - Name of the game
  - Genre
  - What is the purpose of the game
  - Rules
  - Mechanics
  - Platform
  - What is the reward system
  - In your opinion, what makes the game addictive/enjoyable to play?

- Alternatively, if you do not play video games:
  - Open Scratch by clicking on [[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/79700266/#editor/][this]] link.
  - Once inside the project, click the green flag icon (top-middle of screen) to run the program.
  - Replace the 'Square' command with 'Pentagon', as directed on the page.
  - *TASK:* Make the program draw a pentagon. Upload a screenshot of your code and of the shape.
  - Swap the 'pentagon' command for 'pattern'. Think about how this works.
  - *TASK:* Modify the code to make a program to draw a pattern of your own.
    - You could have something made from 50 triangles
    - Or a square, then a pentagon one after the other before rotating a bit and repeating
    - Or you could change the pen colour a bit after each shape is drawn.
  - Remember - you can't break anything, so don't be afraid to experiment.
  - Upload a screenshot of your best pattern AND a shot of your code to BourneToLearn.
